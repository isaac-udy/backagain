# GitHub Actions signs in to Google with Workload Identity Federation: each job trades the OIDC
# token GitHub issues it for a short-lived Google token. There is no service account key to leak
# or rotate.
#
# Two conditions stand between a workflow and the deployer: the provider only accepts tokens from
# this repository's jobs in the deploy environment, and the deployer only trusts that environment.
